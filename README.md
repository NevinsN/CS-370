Current/Emerging Trends in CS

-Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For the pirate agent, I was provided all of the supporting code. I was responsible for the deep RL portion and the training requires to get the pirate properly finding the treasure. 

-Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
-What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are responsible for creating programs to interface with computers and machines in order to accomplish tasks in a more convienent or efficent manner than could be done by humans alone. Without computer scientists, average users wouldn't be able to interact with computers, phones, video game consoles, and so much more. Even military equitment and vehicles run on software developed by computer scientists. With a world that is more and more connected, it's pivitol to have computer scientists that are dedicated to safe and ethical code. 

-How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I first approach problems from the needs of the user. Starting with thorough requirements does wonders in delivering an efficient and effective product. I then consider how to modularly approach the design, in order to keep the program secure, maintainable, and effective. 

-What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I am responsible for the damages my code could inflict. This could be responsible and secure management of sensotove information, or preventing real harm to an end user. I also need to be mindful of how bad actors might utilize my program. A company that employs me could suffer serious financial and public image issues if I shop bad code. It's vital I develop responsibly and ethically.
